Product_Price_Custom_Calculator

Welcome to my custom Calculator!

My name is Merissa Bridgeman and I am part of section B CS 1.0 Class.

Here, is a calcultor that gives a suggestion on what to price your product for! 
To start, we need two inputs from the user. From there, given 1. the total cost to produce your product and 2. the desired markup profit you'd like to receive. From there it will calculate what price you need to sell at in order to reach your goal!

This program was coded in python 3.79.

This program is self explanatory but in case where users input an invalid answer, it will prompt you to give a valid answer and notify what made it invalid.
