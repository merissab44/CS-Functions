#Product_Price_Custom_Calculator

Welcome to my custom Calculator!

My name is Merissa Bridgeman and I am part of section B CS 1.0 Class.

Here, is a calcultor that gives a suggestion on what to price your product for! 
To start, we need two inputs from the user. From there, given 1. the total cost to produce your product and 2. the desired markup profit you'd like to receive, will calculate what price you need to sell at in order to reach your goal!

This program guides you through the instructions but also will give an error message
